# Text-Editor

<a name="descsection"></a>
## Description
Welcome to J.A.T.E, or "just another text editor".  JATE is a text editor that runs in the browser. This app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline, lucky you.
